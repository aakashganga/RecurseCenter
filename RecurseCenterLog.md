### Recurse Center Log

##7/6/15:
#SQL project
* fixed outstanding bugs from before RC
* made everything lowercase
* converted times to integers for SQL
* got create statement to work
* added security to SQL commands

##7/7/15:
#SQL project
* got append statement to work
* got program to run with full restaurants file
#workshops: Git!
* installed Magit
* learned about pull requests and merges for Git
* changed default editor to emacs, ediff for merges
#other things
* read book about focusing data science process on questions and
  actionable results, not methods and the dataset itself

##7/8/15:
#SQL project
* tested SQL database, and got it to populate!
* read about possible algorithms
* realized that beta distribution will be difficult to interpret, did
some reading on prediction algorithms
#workshops: blogging with GitHub!
* learned how to make a GitHub pages site with jekyll

##7/9/15:
#SQL project
* Discussed options for analysis of distribution data: seems that
  logistic regression can work for multiple nominal categories, and
  could supplement this by considering results with star rating
  treated as continuous... linear or log odds link?
* Learned how to join tables! Will be useful for setting up a more
complex but simpler to query/interpret database
* Also learned that Yelp structured its data like crap. Refocusing on
implementing database for messy data. PostgreSQL vs SQLite?
* Learned basics of ORM for setting up and querying databases through
  Python. No more painstaking building of strings! Now just
  painstaking building of classes, then simpler times afterward.

#workshops: Git Internals!
* Learned about how Git stores files and changes, and how it thinks
about merges
* Learned about how Git treats remotes/clones (still a little shaky on
  this part)

#other things
* Presentations!
* Submitted no track changes pdf to PLoS, yay for me

##7/10/15:
#Job day: Make your own version control
* Made basic version control in Python
* init, commit, log, checkout, latest, print current, diff
* Next steps: status, print warnings, improve diff to include modified
files
#other things
* updated Git and got Magit running
* read through basic Magit tutorial
* learned about emacs keybindings and made shortcuts in my .emacs!


#SQL project:
-try to create a stupid simple database using SQLalchemy, to make sure
I understand it
-try to create old dumb restaurants database in SQLalchemy
-set up same flat database, but with categories and category join
-given success on those things, start to do the big complicated schema
I am planning in my head

#other things
-write up a little thingy about pull requests and git config files, so
I don't forget it all!
- clean up github random projects

##Things to look into at some point:
