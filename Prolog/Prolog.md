## An Embarassingly Basic Intro to Prolog

I liked Prolog as soon as I opened it in my terminal. It prompts you
with `?-`. The way I see it, it's not waiting for instructions, it's
saying "What do you want to know?".

Then, I tried something basic. `x = 2.` Prolog responds with
`false.`.

?- X = 2.
X = 2.

?- X.
% ... 1,000,000 ............ 10,000,000 years later
% 
%       >> 42 << (last release gives the question)
